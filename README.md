# Mintlyfy Clone Project

Hey there! 👋 This is my attempt at cloning the Mintlyfy landing page. It's a cool little project where I'm trying to replicate the design and layout using HTML and CSS.

## What's inside?

You'll find `index.html` for the main structure and `style.css` for all the visual jazz. Plus, there's an `assets` folder packed with all the images and icons used in the design.

## How to check it out

Super easy! You can either open the `index.html` file in your web browser, or check out the live version here: [webdev.nitishkumar.cloud](https://mintlify-clone.nitishkumar.cloud/)

That's it!

Hope you like it! 😊
